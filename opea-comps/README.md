# Figuring Out OPEA (Open Platform for Enterprise AI)

## Week 1

[simple-service](https://github.com/VennieSo/free-genai-bootcamp-2025/tree/main/opea-comps/simple-service) runs Ollama from docker.

Did not complete MegaService.

[aipc-example](https://github.com/VennieSo/free-genai-bootcamp-2025/tree/main/opea-comps/aipc-example) is just a reference copied from GenAIExamples


## Week 3

[translation-mega-service](https://github.com/VennieSo/free-genai-bootcamp-2025/tree/main/opea-comps/translation-mega-service)

Complete service end to end. 

Due to the modular design of OPEA, it can be customized in the future for the language school's needs with ease.

Does not work for Docker deployment yet.
