### Experience

Took the prompt written for ChatGPT to experiment. Responses are more verbose than expected. 


Pros:
- placeholders are more complete, including mentions of particles, or hinting tenses/form for verbs.
e.g. 
    >Sentence Structure Pattern:
    >[time] [subject] [particle] [location] [particle] [verb-polite-future]

Cons:
- when given an attempt it will ask for tweaks, but it is same as the final accepted solution -- i.e. it did not accept a solution which is accepted later on.
- **after 9 messages the free use limits was reached, and the account was locked for further messages**
    - This is a major limitation in actual use, rendering it practically unusable. Abandoned.
