### Experience

I asked ChatGPT to help me create the initial prompt. 

It gave reasonable results, able to provide vocabulary translations and hints without immediately giving away the correct sentence.

Vocabulary were not provided in table form, and initially did not include romanji (so I could not understand any of the kana).

On user input review it did provide the correct ansswer.

**I hit the free-tier limit after just 7 inputs.**

With the severe limitations of free-tier, I have to abandon ChatGPT free-tier as a candidate.
