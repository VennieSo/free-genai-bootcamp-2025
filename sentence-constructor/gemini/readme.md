### Experience

Took the prompt written for ChatGPT to experiment. It worked better than expected right out of the gate.


Gemini 2.0 Flash took on a fun persona which is quite delightful, constantly adding encouragement in romanji (examples below), which is great for a beginner student.

Fun quips from Gemini:
> Ganbatte! (Good luck!)  
> Hai, wakarimashita. (Yes, I understand.)  
> Daijoubu desu! (That's correct!)  


**One thing to note is that Gemini didn't need to ask for input sentences, and instead would provide them.**


**Pros:**
- With Gemini providing the sentences, as they are completed, it even suggested to increase the difficulty incrementally, introducing new sentence structures or additional constructs like adverbs. A nice surprise!
E.g. 
  - `I drink coffee at the cafe.`  
    This sentence introduces a new element: a location. Think about how to express "at" in Japanese.
  - `I give a present to Mary.`  
    This sentence introduces the concept of giving something to someone. Think carefully about the particle used to indicate the recipient of the gift.
  - `I eat a delicious apple.`  
    Think about where adjectives typically go in relation to the noun they modify in Japanese.
- placeholders are more accurate in terms of the ordering, it is able to follow the correct Japanese word order most consistently.
e.g. 
    >Sentence Structure Pattern:  
    >[subject] [object] [particle] [recipient] [particle] [verb]

**Cons:**
- after a while Gemini started providing vocabulary in conjugated form.
