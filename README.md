# free-genai-bootcamp-2025
Homework submissions for the GenAI Bootcamp from ExamPro

Note: weeks are referenced according to course content, and not the actual week count in the bootcamp.


## Pre-Week:

### [Sentence Constructor](https://github.com/VennieSo/free-genai-bootcamp-2025/tree/main/sentence-constructor)

**Outcome:** gained better understanding of prompting techniques. Observed performances between different models. Experimented with Qwen model (in original homework submission it was mistyped as DeepSeek) and found that the model mixed up Chinese and Japanese, likely due to training data. One key learning - giving positive examples is much more effective than negatives ("don't do X").
